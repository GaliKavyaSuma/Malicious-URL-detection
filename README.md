# Malicious-URL-detection
This project aims to detect and classify URLs as benign or malicious, covering categories like phishing, malware, and defacement. The notebook analyzes URL datasets and applies machine learning models to classify URL types.
# Project Overview
Data: A dataset containing labeled URLs, with categories including benign, phishing, malware, and defacement.
Goal: To build a model capable of accurately classifying URLs as malicious or benign based on patterns and characteristics.
Techniques Used:
Data exploration and visualization.
Model training with XGBoost and LightGBM.
(Any URL set can be taken considering that that formatting and functions doesn't affect them in different way.)

# Results:
The project includes visualizations (e.g., word clouds) and evaluation metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification reports to assess model performance.
